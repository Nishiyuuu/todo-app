## How It Works

1. **Adding Tasks**: When the user enters a task and clicks "Add Task," the task is added to the list displayed on the page. The task is also saved in the browser's local storage to persist between sessions.

3. **Task Filtering**: Users can filter tasks by clicking on the "Show All Tasks," "Show Incomplete Tasks," or "Show Completed Tasks" buttons. This functionality helps users focus on specific sets of tasks based on their completion status.
